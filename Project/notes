Postgres run on docker container as normal deployment for convieniece only, should do stateful set or smh

Remember to connect to pgadmin as host : Postgres   // since it's running on docker container not localhost


// to fix the port not opening issue in docker run these
net stop winnat
docker start container_name
net start winnat

before logger service added to container,
it listen to the localhost 27017
